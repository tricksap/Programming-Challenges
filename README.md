# JavaScript Programming Challenges

Welcome to my repository of solved problems on programming challenges in JavaScript. This is a collection of problems for concept, algorithm, and data structure problem-solving skills. Each solution will be written with clean, efficient code.

## ðŸš€ Repository Overview

This repository is a growing collection of programming challenges, each tackled using JavaScript. The problems come from various coding platforms and focus on strengthening core concepts like:

- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Recursion
- Functional Programming
- Object-Oriented Programming

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

Each challenge is organized in its own folder, containing:

- `README.md` â€“ a brief explanation of the problem.
- `solution.js` â€“ the JavaScript code that solves the problem.
- (Optional) `test.js` â€“ unit tests for the solution, if applicable.

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Challenge-1
